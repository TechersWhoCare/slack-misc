TechersWhoCare Slack Code of Conduct
====================================

Welcome!
--------

This Slack started life as a means to help organize and promote communication between people organizing around the [2017 March For Science](http://marchforsciencela.com).

The current admins are:

* [Michael Hucka](mhucka@caltech.edu)
* Someone else

We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone.  All members are expected to show respect and courtesy to other members.  We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form; participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

This code of conduct is a living document, so feel free to suggest changes or additions to the Slack admins.

Membership and discretion
-------------------------

This Slack is open to the Caltech community, but to protect members' privacy, it is not open to the general public.  Generally, only people who demonstrate they have `@caltech.edu` email address will be accepted to the Slack, although people can choose to sign up with other addresses if they wish.

Be aware that even step this provides only limited privacy.  As a member, you may wish to pick a handle that does not easily identify you, as well as sign up with a non-Caltech email address and take further steps to protect your privacy, in order to reduce unwelcome attention in real life.

Despite our best efforts, Slacks are never fully private.  You should assume that nothing is really private, even direct messages between members.

Expected Behavior
-----------------

* Be welcoming.
* Be kind.
* Look out for each other.

Unacceptable Behavior
---------------------

* Conduct or speech which might be considered sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature.
  * Do not use unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory or inappropriate nicknames or terms.
  * Do not show disrespect towards others. (Jokes, innuendo, dismissive attitudes.)
* Intimidation or harassment (online or in-person).
* Disrespect towards differences of opinion.
* Inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where theyâ€™re not appropriate
* Not understanding the differences between constructive criticism and disparagement.
* Sustained disruptions.
* Violence, threats of violence or violent language.
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Publication of non-harassing private communication.

Reporting
---------

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins. They'll respond as promptly as they can.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

Enforcement
-----------

* Understand that speech and actions have consequences, and unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
* If you are the subject of, or witness to any violations of this Code of Conduct, please contact the admins.
* If violations occur, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from this slack and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints.
